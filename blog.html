										<p>I recently came across this article "Whether You’re Qualified Depends on How You’re Quantified" by Michael Schrage in The Harvard Business Review.
                                            The article discusses the growing importance of quantifying one's skills and achievements in the professional world. It highlights how metrics and data analytics are increasingly used to evaluate candidates' qualifications for jobs, underscoring the need for individuals to present their accomplishments in measurable terms. From this, I'm taking for myself the significance of not only developing a diverse skill set but also being able to articulate and quantify these skills effectively. It's a reminder to continuously seek out measurable achievements and to be proactive in translating experiences into data-driven evidence that showcases my capabilities. This approach is crucial in standing out in a competitive job market where data is everything.</p>
