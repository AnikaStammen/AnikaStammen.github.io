											<p>As a fourth-year Global Business Double Degree student at Dublin City University, I have had the privilege of experiencing a diverse and enriching academic journey, beginning with two years at ESB Business School in Reutlingen and finalising my studies in Ireland. This unique blend of educational environments has equipped me with a <strong>perspective on global business practices</strong> and an <strong>adaptable, innovative mindset.</strong></p>
											<p>My professional journey has been equally dynamic, starting with valuable internship experience in a <strong>corporate incubator</strong> which turned into a working student job. There I honed my skills in identifying and nurturing <strong>innovative business solutions.</strong> The culmination of my hands-on learning came with another internship that transitioned into a role as a working student in <strong>Product Management of an analytics platform</strong> in a leading global tech company.</p>

									<p>My career aspirations are deeply rooted in the <strong>tech industry,</strong> driven by a passion to make a <strong>tangible impact on people's lives through technology.</strong> I am committed to leveraging my skills in product management and my understanding of global business dynamics and data analytics to develop technologies that are not only innovative but also <strong>accessible and user-friendly.</strong> My goal is to be at the forefront of tech solutions that simplify complex challenges, making daily life more manageable and enjoyable for people around the world.</p>

									<h3>Data Analytics in Seed Testing</h3>
									<p>As the CEO of a tech startup, we are about to be introducing an innovative seed testing machine that is set to transform the seed breeding industry. Our machine, distinguished by its advanced imaging technology and a specialized camera, is adept at predicting seed germination rates with unprecedented accuracy and within short amounts of time. This leap forward is made possible by leveraging sophisticated data analytics and image recognition algortihms, allowing us to significantly reduce the time traditionally required for germination prediction while enhancing the precision of our results.</p>
									<p>Understanding the importance of user experience, we've developed a companion software that is as intuitive as it is powerful. Accessible through an easy-to-use web application, it democratizes seed testing, making it accessible to a broad audience without compromising on functionality. Our aim is to streamline the seed testing process, moving away from the protracted timelines associated with conventional lab tests to offer rapid, reliable insights.</p>
									<p>This venture is not just about technological innovation; it's about redefining the approach to seed germination testing. By making advanced testing capabilities available at the user's fingertips, we're not only accelerating the pace of seed research and development but also empowering users with immediate, actionable data. Our ultimate goal is to enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability by providing tools that are both cutting-edge and accessible, thereby supporting the growth of a more food-secure future.</p>

									<h3>Accessibilty in Data Analytics Platforms</h3>
									<p>During my internship at a leading technology company, I was immersed in the role of a Product Manager for their data analytics platform, a position that not only improved my skills in product development but also deepened my understanding of the tech industry's nuances and the importance of data analytics and the power data holds. This invaluable experience transitioned into a working student role, where I took over the role of PM for accessibilty within the product. 
									<p>Emphasizing accessible software formed a major part of my work, understanding its vital role in democratizing technology and complying to regulations made by governments and global corporations. Making software accessible means ensuring it can be efficiently used by everyone, including those with disabilities. This involves integrating features like keyboard navigation for those unable to use a mouse, screen readers for the visually impaired, and clear, intuitive interfaces that cater to a broad spectrum of users. Working on these aspects, I've come to appreciate how such inclusivity not only broadens our user base but also enriches the user experience, making technology a tool for empowerment rather than a barrier.</p>
									<p> Check out this blog post I wrote for the company I am working in on keyboard accessibility.
