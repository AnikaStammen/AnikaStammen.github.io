											<h3><a id="project-2" href="https://github.com/AnikaStammen/NLPChatbotPython" target="_blank">Natural Language Processing in Chatbots - Python</a></h3>
											<a href="https://github.com/AnikaStammen/NLPChatbotPython" target="_blank" class="image"><img src="images/chatbot nlp.jpg" alt="" style="width:50%;"/></a>
											
											<p>The report on "Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Chatbots" explores how keyword extraction, particularly through the TF-IDF algorithm, enhances customer service efficiency in the digital era. By automating interactions and improving response quality, this implementation aims to streamline operations and enhance customer engagement without escalating human labor costs, thus offering substantial business value.</p>
											
											<h4>Data Description</h4>
											<p>The analysis is based on textual data from customer service interactions across various industries. The focus is on extracting keywords that are critical for understanding customer queries and improving chatbot interactions. Data cleaning and feature engineering are emphasized to prepare the data for effective NLP application.</p>
											
											<h4>Analysis and Insights</h4>
											<p>The report finds that NLP, through mechanisms like the TF-IDF algorithm, significantly aids in managing and responding to customer queries by identifying key terms and phrases that are crucial for the chatbot's response accuracy. This allows for handling a higher volume of inquiries with promptness and relevance, enhancing overall customer service efficiency.</p>
											
											<h4>Visualizations</h4>
											<p>Visual aids in the report include word clouds that compare the impact of the TF-IDF algorithm on keyword significance in customer service texts.

											</figure>
											<p></p>
											<h4>Model Description</h4>
											<p>The TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) model is described as an effective tool for keyword extraction in text processing. It calculates the importance of a word based on its frequency in a single document relative to its frequency across all documents, which helps in prioritizing words that are unique and informative over common and less significant ones.</p>
											
											<h4>Results</h4>
											<p>The application of the TF-IDF model in chatbots significantly improves the interaction quality by enabling the chatbot to focus on important words and phrases. This targeted approach allows for more accurate and contextually relevant responses, enhancing the user experience and efficiency of customer service operations.</p>
											
											<h4>Conclusion and Recommendations</h4>
											<p>The integration of NLP in customer service, particularly through TF-IDF, shows promise in transforming customer interaction frameworks. The report concludes with a recommendation to further explore advanced NLP techniques and continuous model training to address the nuances and complexities of human language, which will improve the reliability and adaptability of NLP applications in customer service environments.</p>

											<p>The "G20 Energy and Sustainability Analysis" project utilized Power BI to develop an interactive report on environmental data from G20 countries. This initiative aimed to provide insights into energy use, pollution levels, renewable energy adoption, and overall sustainability practices across these nations, facilitating better policy decisions and awareness regarding global environmental impacts.</p>

											<h4>Data Description</h4>
											<p>The raw data, sourced from the World Bank, consisted of numerous environmental metrics such as CO2 emissions, methane emissions, renewable energy consumption, and pollution levels from the G20 countries covering the period from 1990 to 2022. This dataset underwent extensive cleaning, normalization, and transformation to ensure accurate and insightful visualizations.</p>

											<h4>Analysis and Insights</h4>
											<p>The analysis highlighted significant findings including stagnant per capita CO2 emissions among G20 countries since 1990, a slight rise in overall energy consumption, and varying renewable energy adoption rates. Developed countries showed higher per capita emissions while emerging nations had higher total emissions, indicating differing environmental impacts and sustainability challenges.</p>

											<h4>Visualizations</h4>
											<p>The Power BI report featured dynamic visualizations that allowed users to explore data across multiple dimensions, including time series analysis of emissions, comparative renewable energy usage, and pollution metrics across different countries. Interactive elements in the report enabled stakeholders to drill down into specific data points for more detailed insights.</p>

											<h3><a id="project-5" href="https://github.com/AnikaStammen/BookstoreDatabaseSQL" target="_blank">Bookstore Database - SQL</a></h3>
											<a href="https://github.com/AnikaStammen/BookstoreDatabaseSQL" target="_blank" class="image"><img src="images/bookstore.jpg" alt="" style="width:80%;"/></a>
											
											<p>The Bookstore Database Management project focuses on structuring and manipulating a relational database tailored for an online bookstore. This database is designed to track customers, book inventories, and order details, facilitating efficient management and enhancing customer service capabilities. The robust SQL setup allows for real-time insights into sales trends, customer preferences, and inventory management.</p>

											<h4>Data Description</h4>
											<p>Data is constructed within three primary tables: <em>customers</em>, <em>books</em>, and <em>orders</em>. Each table is populated with representative data:
											<ul>
												<li>The <em>customers</em> table includes entries featuring customer details such as name, email, and address.</li>
												<li>The <em>books</em> table holds diverse entries covering various genres like Fantasy, Dystopian, and Literature, with titles ranging from classic literature to modern biographies.</li>
												<li>The <em>orders</em> table interlinks customers and books, reflecting purchasing patterns through multiple order entries, including book IDs, customer IDs, quantities, and order dates.</li>
											</ul>
											</p>
											
											<h4>Analysis and Insights</h4>
											<p>The SQL queries provide dynamic analysis capabilities:
											<ul>
												<li>Product-based queries identify books under a specific price threshold or books that have not yet been ordered.</li>
												<li>Customer-based insights reveal ordering patterns, highlighting frequent buyers or those purchasing multiple books in a single transaction.</li>
												<li>Time-sensitive queries retrieve orders within specific date ranges, facilitating seasonal analysis and marketing strategies.</li>
											</ul>
											</p>
											
											<h4>Operational Commands and Manipulations</h4>
											<p>Operational commands within the project allow for real-time data updates, including:
											<ul>
												<li>Adding new entries to the <em>customers</em> and <em>books</em> tables.</li>
												<li>Adjusting book prices and order quantities, ensuring the database reflects current market conditions and stock levels.</li>
												<li>Comprehensive deletion commands prepare the system for clean-ups or restructuring, like removing data entries without corresponding transactions.</li>
											</ul>
											</p>
											
											<h4>Results</h4>
											<p>This SQL implementation enhances operational efficiency and customer relationship management within the bookstore context. It allows for swift adjustments to the database in response to business needs, ensuring data integrity and relevance.
